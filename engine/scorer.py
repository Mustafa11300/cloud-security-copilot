RISK SCORE CALCULATOR
======================
Takes all findings and computes:
1. Overall Security Posture Score (0-100, higher = safer)
2. Cost Health Score (0-100, higher = less waste)
3. Per-resource risk contribution

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: Like a credit score — a single number that
summarizes complex underlying data into something actionable.

🔦 LOGIC FOCUS: The scoring formula weights are business decisions.
We chose these weights based on real-world impact data:
- CRITICAL findings get -20 because they represent immediate breach risk
- HIGH gets -10 because they represent significant exploitable vulnerabilities  
- MEDIUM gets -5 for compliance and best practice gaps
- LOW gets -2 for hygiene issues
"""


def calculate_security_score(findings: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Calculates a 0-100 security posture score.

    🔦 LOGIC: Start at 100, subtract for each finding.
    We use a WEIGHTED PENALTY system rather than a simple count
    because 1 CRITICAL finding is worse than 10 LOW findings.

    Formula:
    score = max(0, 100 - (critical*20) - (high*10) - (medium*5) - (low*2))

    WHY THIS FORMULA?
    - Reflects real-world risk weighting used by frameworks like CVSS
    - Ensures CRITICAL issues have outsized impact on the score
    - Score of 0 = catastrophically insecure (many critical issues)
    - Score of 100 = perfectly clean (no findings)
    - Score of 70+ = acceptable for most organizations
    - Score below 50 = urgent remediation needed
